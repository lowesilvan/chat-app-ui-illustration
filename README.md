## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (SASS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first time I designed using mobile first approach and using SASS as well. Now I get the feeling I wrote fewer lines of code than I would with normall CSS and my code is cleaner.


### Useful resources

- [SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
